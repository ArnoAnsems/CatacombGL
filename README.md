# Introduction
CatacombGL is a Windows source port of the DOS games The Catacomb Abyss and The Catacomb Armageddon. These games were originally developed in 1992 by Softdisk Publishing. They are first person shooters with a fantasy theme. The original games visualized their 3D graphics in 16 colors and a 320x200 pixels view window. The main goal of the CatacombGL source port is to utilize OpenGL to improve the visual presentation of The Catacomb Abyss and The Catacomb Armageddon. This source port is currently a work-in-progress and as such in the alpha development phase. However, with the current version it is possible to play through both games entirely, as all levels, monsters and bonus items are present and functional. 

Main features: 
* Runs native on Windows 7/8/10. 
* Hardware accelerated 3D rendering via OpenGL, supporting widescreen resolutions, a customizable field of view and an uncapped frame rate. 
* Player, projectile and monster movement with floating point precision. 
* Supports The Catacomb Abyss version 1.13 (shareware) and version 1.24 (as included in the Catacombs Pack from gog.com). 
* Supports The Catacomb Armageddon version 1.02 (as included in the Catacombs Pack from gog.com).
* WASD and mouselook.

Current limitations as of version 0.2.0: 
* No support for game controllers. 
* No backwards compatibility with saved games from the original DOS game. 
* Only Adlib sound card emulation; no PC speaker emulation. 
* No "demo" functionality (preview slideshow of Catacomb Armageddon and Apocalypse in shareware version). 
* No fade-in effect when entering a level. 

# How to install
CatacombGL does not run standalone, but requires the original game data (levels, pictures, sounds, etc) to be present on the system. The Catacomb Abyss game data can be obtained legitimately and free-of-charge by downloading the 1.13 shareware version. Various websites offer the shareware version for download, see for example https://archive.org/details/TheCatacombAbyss. Alternatively, the game data can also be obtained by buying the Catacombs Pack from gog.com, see https://www.gog.com/game/catacombs_pack. The differences between the shareware and commercial versions are purely cosmetic. The Catacombs Pack is required in order to run The Catacomb Armageddon.
The CatacombGL.exe can be run from any location. When started, a selection screen with an overview of all the supported games is shown. In case the Catacombs Pack was installed via the GOG installer, the game data will be auto-detected. Otherwise, it is possible to manually browse to the folder which contains either the Catacombs Pack or the shareware version.

# Controls
The keyboard and mouse controls for moving, shooting, etc. can be customized via the in-game menu. The following keys are reserved and cannot be customized: 
* ESC - open/close the menu 
* Function keys - various shortcuts, such as F3 for saving the game and F4 for restoring the game
* Numerical keys - read scrolls
* Backspace - cheat codes in Armageddon

# History
* Version 0.2.0 (2019-03-31) New in this release:
  * Support for the Catacomb Armageddon! All levels and monsters are present. Requires the Catacombs Pack.
  * Game selection screen with the option to manually browse to a folder with game data. Suggested by Master O.
  * Support for x64 builds. Implemented by Arsen "Honeybunch" Tufankjian.
  * Support for full screen and borderless windowed mode.
  * In game help screens. Accessible via the F1 key.
  * Customizable player turn speed. Suggested by doomjedi.
  * Customizable player run button. By default, the run button is not bound to any key, since the original games did not support running. Suggested by doomjedi and Tricob.
  * Fix: enemies with a melee attack now randomly show the attack animation even when out of range.
  * Fix: fireballs from the player can now pass through keys, gems and scrolls.
  * Fix: fireballs from the player now pass through enemies during the 'rise' animations.
  * Fix: hour glass (freeze time powerup) is now destructable.
  * Fix: speed of water monsters is set to 2200 when above water and 1200 when submerged.
  * Fix: monsters with projectiles aim better when standing close to the player.
  * Fix: projectiles from monsters can no longer cause walls to explode.
  * Fix: nemesis could fail to drop the red key when many projectiles were active after using the freeze time powerup.
  * Fix: in the restore game or save game menu, scrolling did not work properly when the list of saved games did not fill up the whole page.
  
* Version 0.1.0 (2018-09-10) Initial release. This source port is currently a work-in-progress and as such in the alpha development phase. Some functionality has yet to be implemented and existing functionality was only tested on a very limited set of test systems. However, with the current version it is possible to play through the entire game, as all levels, monsters and bonus items are present and functional.

# Roadmap
The following releases are planned:
* Version 0.3.0: support for the Catacomb Apocalypse.
* Version 0.4.0: support for Catacomb 3-D: The Descent.
